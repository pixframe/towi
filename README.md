# Towi Portal Backend

Towi was born as a platform to evaluate and develop cognitive abilities in children between 6 and 12 years old.

Now, thanks to the support of the UNICEF INNOVATION FUND, it is also a research tool that incorporates elements of big data and artificial intelligence to obtain information about childrenÂ´s cognitive abilities and the learning difficulties that they can present, among other topics of scientific, psychological and educative interest.
